First of All I tried to make this form dynamic as much as possible thats why at the first glance u will see no flight schedules .
=>Enter  "IST" at from input field .

It will filter the flights which will start from IST airport .

=> Enter "DAC" also to find the filtered result .
=>Enter "FCO" in the "to" input field this also will provide filtered result .

=> IF I click at search button the from data will be submitted . At console you can see the submitted data .

=> As I used react I tried to seperate each task into seperate components . 

=> Took nearly 5-6 hours of woork
